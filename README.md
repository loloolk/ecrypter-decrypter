## Description
A complex encoder/decoder algorithm, based on a single key. The algorithm is able to encode and decode any string, using a key that is generated by the algorithm itself. The key is generated by the algorithm, based on the input string. The key is used to encode the input string, and the same key is used to decode the encoded string. The algorithm is able to encode and decode any string, regardless of its length, and it is able to encode and decode any string, regardless of its content.
